  You may want to write an induction proof. You can use the induction commands as follows:
  \begin{induction}
    \begin{basecase}
      This is your base case.
    \end{basecase}
    \begin{indhyp}
      This is your induction hypothesis.
    \end{indhyp}
    \begin{indstep}
      This is your induction step.
    \end{indstep}
    Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, we have proven our theorem.
  \end{induction}
\end{proof}

\begin{exeru} % This is an exercise that is not numbered.

\end{exeru}
\begin{solution} % This is a proof environment.
  Your solution here.
\end{solution}

\begin{thm} % This is an automatically numbered theorem. For a theorem that isn't numbered, use thmu instead; for a manually numbered theorem, use thmn and add number in a set of curly braces.
  This is a theorem.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof} % This is a proof environment.
  Your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem} % This is an automatically numbered lemma. For a lemma that isn't numbered, use lemu instead; for a manually numbered lemma, use lemn and add number in a set of curly braces.
  This is a lemma.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof} % This is a proof environment.
  Your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{coro} % This is an automatically numbered corollary. For a corollary that isn't numbered, use corou instead; for a manually numbered corollary, use coron and add number in a set of curly braces.
  This is a corollary.
\end{coro}
\begin{proof} % This is a proof environment.
  Your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn} % This is an automatically numbered definition. For a definition that isn't numbered, use defnu instead; for a manually numbered definition, use defnn and add number in a set of curly braces.
  This is a definition.
\end{defn}
